DATA

*) Estimation_Results_SimData.7z: simulated data used to evaluate three models: jointModel, indepModel, and depModel. It includes the codes for analyzing the simulated data and ploting Figures 2-4. 

*)HAPPY_GAIN_RABBIT.7z: simulated data used to compare among RABBBIT, GAIN, and HAPPY. It includes the codes for analyzing the simulated data and producing the Table 1 and plotting Figures S1 and S2. 

*)HAPPY_GAIN_RABBIT_Supplement.7z: simulated data used to compare among RABBBIT, GAIN, and HAPPY. It includes the codes for analyzing the simulated data and producing the Table S6. 

*)Estimation_Results_RealData_ML100_Web.7z: real data of magic line (Magic.100) and the code for analyzing the data and ploting Fiugre 5.

*)Estimation_Results_RealData_PreCC.7z: real data of pre-CC line (IL-8) and the code for analyzing the data and ploting Fiugres 6-7 and Figure S3.
